            <p>ShriBooks Pvt Ltd (“ShriBooks”, “us”, “we”, or “our”) operates the ShriBooks website and the ShriBooks APIs  (collectively, the “Service”). By using the Service, you consent to the use of cookies.</p>
<p>Our Cookie Policy explains what cookies are, how we use cookies, how third-parties we may partner with may use cookies on the Service, your choices regarding cookies and further information about cookies.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-cookies">What are cookies</h2>
<p>Cookies are small pieces of text sent to your web browser by a website you visit. A cookie file is stored in your web browser and allows the Service or a third-party to recognize you and make your next visit easier and the Service more useful to you.</p>
<p>Cookies can be “persistent” or “session” cookies. Persistent cookies remain on your personal computer or mobile device when you go offline, while session cookies are deleted as soon as you close your web browser.</p>
<h2 id="how-shribooks-uses-cookies">How ShriBooks uses cookies</h2>
<p>When you use and access the Service, we may place a number of cookies files in your web browser. We use both session and persistent cookies on the Service and we use different types of cookies to run the Service:</p>
<p>We may use cookies for the following reasons and purposes:</p>
<p><strong>a. Essential cookies</strong> to provide the service you have asked for. Some cookies are essential so you can navigate through the website and use its features. Without these cookies, we would not be able to provide the services you’ve requested. For example, some cookies allow us to identify subscribers and ensure they can access the subscription only pages. If a subscriber opts to disable these cookies, the user will not be able to access all of the content that a subscription entitles them to. These cookies don’t gather information about you that could be used for marketing or remembering where you’ve been on the internet. Essential cookies keep you logged in during your visit.</p>
<p><strong>b. Preferences cookies</strong> to improve your browsing experience. We may use preferences cookies to remember information that changes the way the Service behaves or looks, such as the “remember me” functionality of a registered user or a user’s language preference. These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make, your settings, including marketing preferences, remembering if you’ve filled in certain forms, so you’re not asked to do it again.</p>
<p><strong>c. Analytics cookies</strong>. To improve your experience on our Service, we like to keep track of what pages and links are popular and which ones don’t get used so much to help us keep our Service relevant and up to date. It’s also very useful to be able to identify trends of how people navigate (find their way through) our Service and if they get error messages from web pages. This group of cookies, often called “analytics cookies” are used to gather this information. These cookies don’t collect information that identifies you. The information collected is anonymous and is grouped with the information from everyone else’s cookies. We can then see the overall patterns of usage rather than any one person’s activity.</p>
<h2 id="thirdparty-cookies">Third-party cookies</h2>
<p>In addition to our own cookies, we may also use various third-parties cookies to report usage statistics of the Service, deliver advertisements on and through the Service, and so on.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-your-choices-regarding-cookies">What are your choices regarding cookies</h2>
<p>If you’d like to delete cookies or instruct your web browser to delete or refuse cookies, please visit the help pages of your web browser.</p>
<p>Please note, however, that if you delete cookies or refuse to accept them, you might not be able to use all of the features we offer, you may not be able to store your preferences, and some of our pages might not display properly.</p>
